                <h1>Overview:</h1>
                <p>We combine the environmental sciences and UX research methods to design an AR experience runs on iOS devices. "CO2 Black" helps users to visualize the carbon dioxide in the environment and educate them on the environmental impact that CO2 creates.</p>

                <p>“CO2 Black” was a 6-month project started in September 2017. Our goals were to familiar with ARKit technology and apply our UX/UI knowledge to develop an AR app. I collaborated with 5 talented developers to create this experience. This was my first time working in AR!
                </p><br>

                <ul>Team members:
                    <li>Brendan Luu - Team Manager</li>
                    <li>Erin Wiegman - Developer</li>
                    <li>Martina Calluori - Developer</li>
                    <li>Jacob Culp - Developer</li>
                    <li>Brendan Russo - Developer</li>
                    <li>Jett Do - Designer</li>

            <div class="section two">
                <h1>Design Process:</h1>
                <p>Each team member got to do individual research on the impact of CO2 on the environment. We then had a discussion to identify the issue and potential solutions. We had several concepts we wanted to experiment such as visualizing the carbon dioxide with AR CO2 molecules and displaying facts on them. Through usability tests, we learned people wanted to do things that are achievable, and familiar to them.
                </p>

                <p>We came up with these experiences that focus on individual, things that people can easily achieve and are familiar with:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Switching a light bulb:</li>
                    <p> We presented users with an AR incandescent bulb. Users are prompted to switch from an incandescent bulb to a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL). Users are also informed on the efficiency of switching to CFL, how to reduce their CO2 emissions by switching off the lights when necessary.
                    </p>
                </ul><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Recycling:</li>
                    <p>We also presented users with an AR recycling bin with a mix of recyclable and non-recyclable items. If a user attempts to recycle a non-recyclable item, it will be rejected from the bin with a message saying why the item was rejected. Through this AR recycling experience, we encourage people to think more about recycling.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="caption">
                    <img src="../../images/product-design/co2-black/trash.gif"></div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Switching to renewable energy:</li>
                    <p>The third AR experience was to educate people on renewable energy. We presented users with two pamphlets, one advertising coal and the other advertising renewable energy such as solar and wind powered energy. Users made their selection and if the renewable energy pamphlet was selected, the app would give more information on how to switch to cleaner energy sources.
                    </p>
                </ul>

            <div class="section three">
                <h1></h1>
                <p>There were refinements to the experience and UI design as we started the iterative process, for example:
                </p>

                <p>Instruction text was extremely important. So the text needed to be readable and to tell users where to look and what to tap. A slightly transparent background was added to the text to make sure the text is readable in all situations.
                </p>

                <p>To motivate users to complete the tasks and to keep track of their progress in the app, upon completion, users would earn an award based on the task they complete.

                <h1>Results and learnings:</h1>
                <p>CO2 Black is the result of 6 people, 6 months, and an entirely new realm of 3D application development. We came together with the hope that when people used our app, they would walk away with the belief that their actions have a direct impact on the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment. One user said after experiencing when going throughout his day, when he would traditionally throw away his morning coffee he went out of his way to recycle it. This result is exactly what we were striving for.
                </p>

                <div class="caption gallery">
                    <a href="../../images/product-design/co2-black/team1.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="../../images/product-design/co2-black/team1.jpg"alt="Team"></a>
                    <p></p>
                </div>

                <p>The last six months was an incredible learning experience for our whole team. We learned that an agile approach is the best approach for this. This is a new technology that not many people have experience with, so it is a delicate balance between pushing the boundaries of the technology and defining interactions that people are comfortable using. We had the special task of not only trying to teach people about CO2 and the impact of their actions, but we also had to teach them how to use AR, usually for the first time. This was a particularly difficult task because we ourselves were learning how to design and develop using AR for the first time.
                </p>
                <div class="caption gallery">
                    <a href="../../images/product-design/co2-black/team.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery"><img src="../../images/product-design/co2-black/team.jpg" alt="Team"></a>
                    <p class="caption"></p>
                </div>

                <p>We wanted to use AR to enhance your experience, and we kept this mindset throughout the development of CO2Black. We found out through user testing that giving instant feedback, whether that is through animations, UI, color, or haptic feedback is very important to show the cause and effect of actions. Lastly, a solid team is one of the most important aspects of a successful project. We were able to depend and rely on each other and that sense of security allowed us to take risks in our ideas and development process.
